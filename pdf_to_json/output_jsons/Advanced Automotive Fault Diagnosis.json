Diagnostic work is much like that of a detective solving a difficult crime, all the clues are usually there -if you know where to look. I think it was Sherlock Holmes (a fictional detective if you have never heard of him!) who said: When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. This is a great thought for a diagnostic technician to keep in mind.",

It is useful, however, to become familiar with a few key wire colours and terminal numbers when diagnosing electrical faults. As seems to be the case for any standardisation a number of colour code systems are in operation! For reference purposes I will just mention two. Firstly, the British Standard system (BS AU 7a: 1983): this system uses 12 colours to determine the main purpose of the cable and tracer colours to further refine its use. The main colour uses and some further examples are given in the following table. Secondly there is a 'European' system used by a number of manufacturers and based broadly on the following table. Please note there is no correlation between the 'Euro' system and the British Standard colour codes. In particular note the use of the colour brown in each system! After some practice with the use of colour code systems the job of the technician is made a lot easier when faultfinding an electrical circuit.  A system now in use almost universally is the terminal designation system in accordance with DIN 72 552. This system is to enable easy and correct connections to be made on the vehicle, particularly in after sales repairs. Note that the designations are not to identify individual wires but to define the terminals of a device. Listed below are some of the most popular numbers. The Ford Motor Company now uses a circuit numbering and wire identification system. This is in use worldwide and is known as Function, System-Connection (FSC). The system was developed to assist in vehicle development and production processes. However, it is also very useful in helping the technician with fault finding. Many of the function codes are based on the DIN system. Note that earth wires are now black! The system works as follows. The new Ford colour codes table is as follows:",
                        "Ford system codes are as follows. As a final point to this section it must be noted that the colour codes and terminal designations given are for illustration only. Further reference should be made for specific details to the manufacturer's information."

How accurately could you measure it to the nearest 0.5 mm? This raises a number of issues. Firstly, you could make an error reading the ruler. Secondly, why do we need to know the length of a bit of wire to the nearest 0.5 mm? Thirdly the ruler may have stretched and not give the correct reading! The first and second of these issues can be dispensed with by knowing how to read the test equipment correctly and also knowing the appropriate level of accuracy required. A micrometer for a plug gap? A ruler for valve clearances? I think you get the idea. The accuracy of the equipment itself is another issue.",
                        "Accuracy is a term meaning how close the measured value of something is to its actual value. For example, if a length of about 30 cm is measured with an ordinary wooden ruler, then the error may be up to 1 mm too high or too low. This is quoted as an accuracy of Ϯ1 mm. This may also be given as a percentage which in this case would be 0.33%.",
                        "Resolution, or in other words the 'fineness' with which a measurement can be made, is related to accuracy. If a steel ruler was made to a very high standard but only had markings of one per centimetre it would have a very low resolution even though the graduations were very accurate. In other words the equipment is accurate but your reading will not be! To ensure instruments are, and remain, accurate there are just two simple guidelines.",

The X plates are supplied with a saw tooth signal, which causes the beam to move across the screen from left to right and then to 'fly back' and start again. Being attracted towards whichever plate has a positive potential the beam moves simply. The Y plates can now be used to show voltage variations of the signal under test. The frequency of the saw tooth signal, known as the time base, can be adjusted either automatically as is the case with many analysers or manually on a stand alone oscilloscope. The signal from the item under test can either be amplified or attenuated (reduced), much like changing the scale on a voltmeter. The trigger, in other words when the trace across the screen starts, can be caused internally or externally. In the case of the engine analyser triggering is often external, each time an individual spark fires or each time number one spark plug fires.",

Because the signal is plotted digitally on a screen from data in memory, the 'picture' can be saved, frozen or even printed. The speed of data conversion and the sampling rate as well as the resolution of the screen are very important in ensuring accurate results.

They are called axes because the 'scope' is drawing a graph of the voltage at the test points over a period of time. The time scale can vary from a few s to several seconds. The voltage scale can vary from a few mV to several kV. For most test measurements only two connections are needed just like a voltmeter. The time scale will operate at intervals pre-set by the user. It is also possible to connect a 'trigger' wire so that, for example, the time scale starts moving across the screen each time the ignition coil fires.

Under certain conditions, misfire detection can be difficult; particularly at light load with high engine speed. Under these conditions the damping of firing pulses is low due to the light engine load and this creates high momentary accelerations and decelerations of the crankshaft. This causes speed variation which can be mistakenly taken by the OBD system as a misfire. With this method of misfire detection, careful calibration of the OBD system is necessary to avoid false detection. Another vehicle operation mode that can cause problems is operation of the vehicle on rough or poorly made roads.

As the cam turns it moves the follower, which in turn pushes the push rod. The push rod moves the rocker, which pivots on the rocker shaft and pushes the valve open. As the cam moves further it allows the spring to close the valve. • Overhead cam with followers Using an overhead cam (OHC) reduces the number of moving parts. In the system shown here the lobe of the cam acts directly on the follower which pivots on its adjuster and pushes the valve open. • Overhead cam, direct acting and automatic adjusters Most new engines now use an OHC with automatic adjustment. This saves on repair and service time and keeps the cost to the customer lower. Systems vary between manufacturers, some use followers and some have the cam acting directly on to the valve. In each case though the adjustment is by oil pressure. A type of plunger, which has a chamber where oil can be pumped under pressure, operates the valve. This expands the plunger and takes up any unwanted clearance.",
                        "Valve clearance adjustment is very important. If it is too large the valves will not open fully and will be noisy. If the clearance is too small the valves will not close and no compression will be possible. When an engine is running the valves become very hot and therefore expand. The exhaust valve clearance is usually larger than the inlet, because it gets hotter. Regular servicing is vital for all components but, in particular, the valve operating mechanism needs a good supply of clean oil at all times. The valve timing diagram shows that the valves of a four stroke engine open just before and close just after the particular stroke. Looking at the timing diagram, if you start at position IVO, the piston is nearly at the top of the exhaust stroke when the inlet valve opens (IVO). The piston reaches the top and then moves down on the intake stroke. Just after starting the compression stroke the inlet valve closes (IVC). The piston continues upwards and, at a point several degrees before top dead centre, the spark occurs and starts the mixture burning.",
                        "The maximum expansion is 'timed' to occur after top dead centre, therefore the piston is pushed down on its power stroke. Before the end of this stroke the exhaust valve opens (EVO). Most of the exhaust gases now leave because of their very high pressure. The piston pushes the rest of the spent gases out as it moves back up the cylinder. The exhaust valve closes (EVC) just after the end of this stroke and the inlet has already opened, ready to start the cycle once again.",
                        "The reason for the valves opening and closing like this is that it makes the engine more efficient by giving more time for the mixture to enter and the spent gases to leave. The outgoing exhaust gases in fact help to draw in the fuel air mixture from the inlet. Overall this makes the engine have a better 'volumetric efficiency'."

For a spark to jump across an air gap of 0.6 mm under normal atmospheric conditions (1 bar) a voltage of 2 to 3 kV is required. For a spark to jump across a similar gap in an engine cylinder having a compression ratio of 8:1 approximately 8 kV is required. For higher compression ratios and weaker mixtures, a voltage up to 20 kV may be necessary. The ignition system has to transform the normal battery voltage of 12 V to approximately 8 to 20 kV and, in addition, has to deliver this high voltage to the right cylinder, at the right time. Some ignition systems will supply up to 40 kV to the spark plugs.",

The ideal ignition timing is dependent on two main factors, engine speed and engine load. An increase in engine speed requires the ignition timing to be advanced. The cylinder charge, of air fuel mixture, requires a certain time to burn (normally about 2 ms). At higher engine speeds the time taken for the piston to travel the same distance reduces. Advancing the time of the spark ensures that full burning is achieved.",

In this situation further ignition advance is necessary. Greater load on the engine requires a richer mixture, which burns more rapidly. In this case some retardation of timing is necessary. Overall, under any condition of engine speed and load an ideal advance angle is required to ensure maximum pressure is achieved in the cylinder just after TDC. The ideal advance angle may also be determined by engine temperature and any risk of detonation.",

The simplest of these is the mechanical system comprising a centrifugal advance mechanism and a vacuum (load sensitive) control unit.

I prefer to consider manifold pressure, albeit less than atmospheric pressure; the absolute manifold pressure (MAP) is proportional to engine load.

The ECU responds to signals from the knock sensor in the engine's knock window for each cylinder; this is often just a few degrees each side of TDC. This prevents clatter from the valve mechanism being interpreted as knock. The signal from the sensor is also filtered in the ECU to remove unwanted noise. If detonation is detected the ignition timing is retarded on the fourth ignition pulse after detection (four cylinder engine), in steps until knock is no longer detected. The steps vary between manufacturers but about 2°is typical.

The system is generally only used on four cylinder engines as the control system becomes too complex for higher numbers. The basic principle is that of the 'lost spark'. The distribution of the spark is achieved by using double ended coils, which are fired alternately by the ECU. The timing is determined from a crankshaft speed and position sensor as well as load and other corrections. When one of the coils is fired a spark is delivered to two engine cylinders, either 1 and 4, or 2 and 3. The spark delivered to the cylinder on the compression stroke will ignite the mixture as normal. The spark produced in the other cylinder will have no effect, as this cylinder will be just completing its exhaust stroke.",

A system which does not require a sensor to determine which cylinder is on compression (engine position is known from a crank sensor) determines the information by initially firing all of the coils. The voltage across the plugs allows measurement of the current for each spark and will indicate which cylinder is on its combustion stroke. This works because a burning mixture has a lower resistance. The cylinder with the highest current at this point will be the cylinder on the combustion stroke.",

On the other hand if the electrode temperature is too low then carbon and oil fouling can occur, as deposits are not burnt off.

The simple relationship between plug gap and voltage required is that as the gap increases so must the voltage (leaving aside engine operating conditions). Further, the energy available to form a spark at a fixed engine speed is constant, which means that a larger gap using higher voltage will result in a shorter duration spark. A smaller gap will allow a longer duration spark. For cold starting an engine and for igniting weak mixtures the duration of the spark is critical. Likewise the plug gap must be as large as possible to allow easy access for the mixture to prevent quenching of the flame.",

Electrical heating is one solution, as is a form of burner which involves lighting fuel inside the converter. Another possibility is positioning the converter as part of the exhaust manifold and down pipe assembly.

When a catalytic converter is in prime condition this is not a problem due to storage capacity within the converter for CO and O 2 . Damaged converters, however, cannot store sufficient quantity of these gases and hence become less efficient. The damage as suggested earlier in this section can be due to overheating or by 'poisoning' due to lead or even silicon. If the control can be kept within 0.5% of lambda the converter will continue to be effective even if damaged to some extent. Sensors are becoming available which can work to this tolerance.

Fuel is metered into the combustion chamber by way of a high pressure pump connected to injectors via heavy duty pipes. When the fuel is injected it mixes with the air in the cylinder and will self ignite at about 800°C. The mixture formation in the cylinder is influenced by the following factors.",

The actual start of injection, in other words when fuel starts to leave the injector, is slightly later than start of delivery, as this is influenced by the compression ratio of the engine, the compressibility of the fuel and the length of the delivery pipes. This timing has a great effect on the production of carbon particles (soot), if too early, and increases the hydrocarbon emissions, if too late.",

Indirect injection systems use pressures up to about 350 bar and direct injection systems can be up to about 1000 bar. Emissions of soot are greatly reduced by higher pressure injection. The direction of injection must match very closely the swirl and combustion chamber design. Deviations of only 2°from the ideal can greatly increase particulate emissions.",

When the winding in the injector housing is energised the core or armature is attracted and the valve opens compressing a return spring. The fuel is delivered in a fine spray to wait behind the closed inlet valve until the induction stroke begins. Providing the pressure across the injector remains constant the quantity of fuel admitted is related to the open period, which in turn is determined by the time the electromagnetic circuit is energised.",

When the fuel pressure is sufficient to move the diaphragm, the valve opens and allows fuel to return to the tank. The decrease in pressure in the manifold, also acting on the diaphragm at say idle speed, will allow the valve to open more easily, hence maintaining a constant differential pressure between the fuel rail and the inlet manifold. This is a constant across the injectors and hence the quantity of fuel injected is determined only by the open time of the injectors. The differential pressure is maintained at about 2.5 bar.",

The action of the thermostat is such as to prevent water circulation from the engine to the radiator, until a set temperature is reached. When the valve opens there is a full circuit for the coolant and a good cooling action occurs because of full flow through the radiator.

When this happens the buildup of pressure inside the filter forces open a spring-loaded relief valve in the housing and the oil bypasses the filter. This valve prevents engine failure, but the engine will be lubricated with dirty oil until the filter is renewed. This is better than no oil! A bypass filtration system was used on older vehicles. This system only filters a proportion of the oil pump output. The remainder is fed directly to the oil gallery. At first view this seems a strange idea but all of the oil does eventually get filtered. The smaller amount through the filter allows a higher degree of filtration."

                        "In its simplest form an oil pump consists of two gear wheels meshed together in a tight space so that oil cannot escape past the sides. The engine drives one wheel. As the gears rotate in opposite directions, the gap between each tooth in each wheel traps a small quantity of oil from an inlet port. The trapped oil is carried round by each wheel towards an outlet port on the opposite side where it is forced out by the meshing teeth.",
                        "The principle of squeezing oil from an everdecreasing space is also used in the rotor type pump. An inner and outer rotor are mounted on different axes in the same cylinder. The inner rotor, which commonly has four lobes, is driven by the engine. It meshes with an outer rotor, which has five lobes. As they rotate, the spaces between them change size. The inlet port is at a point where the space between the rotor lobes is increasing. This draws the oil in to the pump. The oil is then carried round the pump. As rotation continues, the space between the lobes gets smaller. This compresses the oil out of the outlet port.",
                        "Oil pumps can produce more pressure than is required. A valve is used to limit this pressure to a set value. The pressure relief valve is a simple device, which in most cases works on the ball and spring principle. This means that when the pressure on the ball is greater than the spring, the ball moves. The pressure relief valve is placed in the main gallery so that excess pressure is prevented. When the ball moves oil is simply returned to the sump."

The gases escaping from an engine with open crankcase ventilation as described above are very toxic. Legislation now demands a positive closed system of ventilation. This makes the pollution from cylinder blow-by gases negligible. Positive crankcase ventilation is the solution to this problem.",
                        "In early types of closed system crankcase ventilation, the lower pressure at the carburettor air cleaner was used to cause an airflow through the inside of the engine. The breather outlet was simply connected by a pipe to the air cleaner. This caused the crankcase gases to be circulated and then burned in the engine cylinders. A flame trap was included in the system, to prevent a crankcase explosion if the engine backfired.",
                        "In modern closed systems the much lower pressure within the inlet manifold is used to extract crankcase gases. This has to be controlled in most cases by a variable regulator valve or pressure conscious valve (PCV). The valve is fitted between the breather outlet and the inlet manifold. It consists of a spring-loaded plunger, which opens as the inlet manifold pressure reduces. When the engine is stationary the valve is closed. Under normal running conditions the valve opens to allow crankcase gases to enter the inlet manifold with minimum restriction. At low manifold pressures during idling and overrun (pressure is less than atmospheric), further travel of the valve plunger against its spring closes it in the opposite direction. This reduces gas flow to the inlet manifold. This feature makes sure that the fuel control process is not interfered with under these conditions. The valve also acts as a safety device in case of a backfire. Any high pressure created in the inlet manifold will close the valve completely. This will isolate the crankcase and prevent the risk of explosion."

This is often the fastest way to recharge a flat battery.

The key to fast or boost charging is that the battery temperature should not exceed 43°C. With sealed batteries it is particularly important not to let the battery gas excessively in order to prevent the buildup of pressure. A rate of about five times the 'normal' charge setting will bring the battery to 70-80% of its full capacity within approximately one hour. The Repairing modern batteries is not possible. Most of the problems listed will require the battery to be replaced. In the case of sulphation it is sometimes possible to bring the battery back to life with a very long low current charge.

The supply to the field windings is via these contacts. When the output voltage rises beyond a pre-set level, say 14 V, the magnetism in the regulator winding will overcome spring tension and open the contacts.

A simple sensor determines the position of the accelerator and, taking into account other variables such as engine temperature and speed for example, the throttle is set at the optimum position by a servomotor. When accelerating the increase in engine torque leads to an increase in driving torque at the wheels. To achieve optimum acceleration the maximum possible driving torque must be transferred to the road. If driving torque exceeds that which can be transferred then wheel slip will occur on at least one wheel. The result of this is that the vehicle becomes unstable. When wheel spin is detected the throttle position and ignition timing are adjusted but the best results are gained when the brakes are applied to the spinning wheel. This not only prevents the wheel from spinning but acts to provide a limited slip differential action. This is particularly good when on a road with varying braking force coefficients. When the brakes are applied a valve in the hydraulic modulator assembly moves over to allow traction control operation. This allows pressure from the pump to be applied to the brakes on the offending wheel. The valves, in the same way as with ABS, can provide pressure buildup, pressure hold and pressure reduction. This all takes place without the driver touching the brake pedal. The summary of this is that the braking force must be applied to the slipping wheel so as to equalise the combined braking coefficient for each driving wheel.",

One form of design has a nut wrapped round the spiral and is therefore known as a worm and nut steering box. The grooves can be filled with re-circulating ball bearings, which reduce backlash or slack in the system and also reduce friction, making steering lighter. On vehicles with independent front suspension, an idler unit is needed together with a number of links and several joints. The basic weakness of the steering box system is in the number of swivelling joints and connections. If there is just slight wear at a number of points, the steering will not feel or be positive.",

A spring between the wheel and the vehicle body allows the wheel to follow the road surface. The tyre plays an important role in absorbing small road shocks. It is often described as the primary form of suspension. The vehicle body is supported by springs located between the body and the wheel axles. Together with the damper these components are referred to as the suspension system.",

An unsprung wheel is affected only by gravity, which will try to return the wheel to the road surface but most of the energy will be transferred to the body. When a spring is used between the wheel and the vehicle body, most of the energy in the bouncing wheel is stored in the spring and not passed to the vehicle body. The vehicle body will now only move upwards through a very small distance compared to the movement of the wheel."

Two factors must be considered when choosing a suitable resistor, the ohms value and the power rating. Resistors are used to limit current flow and provide fixed voltage drops. Most resistors used in electronic circuits are made from small carbon rods; the size of the rod determines the resistance. Carbon resistors have a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and this must be considered for some applications. Thin-film resistors have more stable temperature properties and are constructed by depositing a layer of carbon on to an insulated former such as glass. The resistance value can be manufactured very accurately by spiral grooves cut into the carbon film. For higher power applications resistors are usually wire wound. Variable forms of most resistors are available. The resistance of a circuit is its opposition to current flow.",
                        "A capacitor is a device for storing an electric charge. In its simple form it consists of two plates separated by an insulating material. One plate can have excess electrons compared to the other. On vehicles its main uses are for reducing arcing across contracts and for radio interference suppression circuits as well as in ECUs. Capacitors are described as two plates separated by a dielectric. The area of the plates, the distance between them and the nature of the dielectric determine the value of capacitance. Metal foil sheets insulated by a type of paper are often used to construct capacitors. The sheets are rolled up together inside a tin can. To achieve higher values of capacitance it is necessary to reduce the distance between the plates in order to keep the overall size of the device manageable. This is achieved by immersing one plate in an electrolyte to deposit a layer of oxide typically 10 Ϫ4 mm thick thus ensuring a higher capacitance value. The problem, however, is that this now makes the device polarity conscious and only able to withstand low voltages.",

A diode is a PN junction allowing electron flow from the N type material to the P type material. The materials are usually constructed from doped silicon. Diodes are not perfect devices and a voltage of about 0.6 V is required to switch the diode on in its forward biased direction.",

The transistor is used as either a solid state switch or as an amplifier. They are constructed from the same P and N type semiconductor materials as the diodes and can be made in either NPN or PNP format. The three terminals are known as the base, collector and emitter. When the base is supplied with the correct bias the circuit between the collector and emitter will conduct. The base current can be in the order of 50 to 200 times less than the emitter current. The ratio of the current flowing through the base compared to the current through the emitter is an indication of the amplification factor of the device. A Darlington pair is a simple combination of two transistors which will give a high current gain, typically several thousand. The transistors are usually mounted on a heat sink and overall the device will have three terminals marked as a single transistor -base, collector and emitter. The input impedance of this type of circuit is in the order of 1 M⍀; hence it will not load any previous part of a circuit connected to its input. The Darlington pair configuration is used for many switching applications. A common use of a Darlington pair is for the switching of coil primary current in the ignition circuit.",

The voltage on the gate terminal controls the conductance of the circuit between the drain and the source.",

Iron cores are used to increase the inductance value.",

The interface between the CAN bus and a CPU is usually called the CAN controller.",
                        "The Bosch CAN specification does not prescribe physical layer specifications. This resulted in two major physical layer designs. Both communicate using a differential voltage on a pair of wires and are often referred to as a high-speed and a low-speed physical layer. The low-speed architecture can change to a single-wire operating method (referenced to earth/ground) when one of the two wires is faulty because of a short or open circuit. Because of the nature of the circuitry required to perform this function, this architecture is very expensive to implement at bus speeds above 125 kbit/s. This is why 125 kbit/s is the division between high-speed and low-speed CAN.",

Reliability, serviceability, and installation issues are improved. • General sensor data, such as vehicle speed, engine temperature and air temperature can be shared. This eliminates the need for redundant sensors.",

If the static on say the bonnet builds up more than on the wing then a spark can be discharged. Using bonding straps to ensure all panels stay at the same potential easily prevents this. Due to the action of the tyres a potential can build up between the wheel rims and the chassis unless suitable bonding straps are fitted. The arc to ground can be as much as 10 kV.",

By choosing suitable values of capacitor in parallel and/or inductor in series it is possible to filter out unwanted signals of certain frequencies.",

The advantage of a rod aerial is that it extends beyond the interference field of the vehicle. For reception in the AM bands the aerial represents a capacitance of 80 pF with a shunt resistance of about 1M⍀. The set will often incorporate a trimmer to ensure that the aerial is matched to the set. Contact resistance between all parts of the aerial should be less than 20 m⍀. This is particularly important for the earth connection.",
                        "When receiving in the FM range the length of the aerial is very important. The ideal length of a rod aerial for FM reception is one quarter of the wavelength. In the middle of the FM band (94 MHz) this is about 80 cm. Due to the magnetic and electrical field of the vehicle and the effect of the coaxial cable, the most practical length is about 1 m. Some smaller aerials are available but whilst these may be more practical the signal strength is reduced. Aerials embedded into the vehicle windows or using the heated rear window element are good from the damage prevention aspect and for insensitivity to moisture, but produce a weaker signal often requiring an aerial amplifier to be included. Note that this will also amplify interference. Some top range vehicles use a rod aerial and a screen aerial, the set being able to detect and use the strongest signal. This reduces the effect of reflected signals and causes less flutter.",

Due to the action of the thermostat in the engine cooling system the water temperature remains broadly constant. This allows for the air being passed over the heater matrix to be heated by a set amount depending on the outside air temperature and the rate of airflow. A source of hot air is therefore available for heating the vehicle interior. However, some form of control is required over how much heat (if any) is required. The method used on most modern vehicles is the blending technique. This is simply a control flap, which determines how much of the air being passed into the vehicle is directed over the heater matrix. The main drawback of this system is the change in air-flow with vehicle speed. Some systems use a valve to control the hot coolant flowing to the heater matrix. By a suitable arrangement of flaps it is possible to direct air of the chosen temperature to selected areas of the vehicle interior. In general, basic systems allow the warm air to be adjusted between the inside of the windscreen and the driver and passenger footwells.

The temperature of the refrigerant at this stage is much higher than the outside air temperature hence it gives up its heat via the fins on the condenser as it changes state back to a liquid. This high-pressure liquid is then passed to the receiver drier where any vapour which has not yet turned back to a liquid is stored, and a desiccant bag removes any moisture (water) that is contaminating the refrigerant. The high-pressure liquid is now passed through the thermostatic expansion valve and is converted back to a lowpressure liquid as it passes through a restriction in the valve into the evaporator. This valve is the element of the system that controls the refrigerant flow and hence the amount of cooling provided. As the liquid changes state to a gas in the evaporator, it takes up heat from its surroundings, thus cooling or 'unheating' the air that is forced over the fins.

This is known as the final drive, and consists of just two gears. These are fitted after the output of the gearbox, on front wheel drive, or in the rear axle after the propshaft on rear wheel drive vehicles. The gears also turn the drive through ninety degrees on rear wheel drive vehicles. The ratio is normally about 4:1; in other words when the gearbox output is turning at 4000 rev/min the wheels will turn at 1000 rev/min. Many cars now have a transverse engine, which drives the front wheels. The power of the engine therefore does not have to be carried through a right angle to the drive wheels. The final drive contains ordinary reducing gears rather than bevel gears.",

The differential also allows one wheel to rotate faster than the other does when necessary. When a car goes around a corner, the outside drive wheel travels further than the inside one. The outside wheel must therefore rotate faster than the inside one to cover the greater distance in the same time. Some higher performance vehicles use limited slip differentials. The clutch plates are connected to the two output shafts and hence if controlled will in turn control the amount of slip.

A transfer box is used to distribute the power between  The transfer gearbox on some vehicles may also contain extra reduction gears for low ratio drive. One problem to overcome, however, with 4 WD is that if three differentials are used then the chance of one wheel slipping actually increases. This is because the drive will always be transferred to the wheel with least traction -like running a 2 WD car with one driving wheel jacked up. To overcome this problem and take advantage of the extra traction available a viscous coupling is combined with an epicyclic gear train to form the centre differential.",

However, the viscous clutch coupling acts so that if a wheel starts to slip, the greater difference in speed across the coupling will cause more friction and hence more drive will pass through the coupling. This tends to act so that the drive is automatically distributed to the most effective driving axle. A 'Hyvo' or silent chain drive is often used to drive from the transfer box."

Most automatic gearboxes now have selector positions for park, neutral, reverse, drive, 2 and 1 (or 3, 2 and 1 in some cases). The engine will only start if the selector is in either the park or neutral position. In park, the drive shaft is locked so that the drive wheels cannot move. It is now quite common when the engine is running to be able to move the selector out of park only if you are pressing the brake pedal. This is a very good safety feature as it prevents sudden movement of the vehicle. For ordinary driving, the driver moves the selector to the drive position. The transmission starts out in the lowest gear and automatically shifts into higher gears as the car picks up speed. The driver can use the lower positions of the gearbox for going up or down steep hills or driving through mud or snow. When in position 3, 2, or 1, the gearbox will not change above the lowest gear specified."

One half, called the pump impeller, is bolted to the drive plate or flywheel. The other half, called the turbine, is connected to the gearbox-input shaft. Each half is lined with vanes or blades.

This force gradually becomes strong enough to rotate the turbine and move the vehicle. A torque converter can double the applied torque when moving off from rest.

The transmitter/transponder would communicate the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and any diagnostic codes that have been logged.

The regulatory authorities could focus their efforts on vehicles and owners who are actually causing a violation rather than just random testing. It is clear that with a system like this, much more efficient use of available regulatory enforcement resources could be implemented, with a consequential improvement in the quality of our air.",
                        "An inevitable change that could come with OBD3 would be even closer scrutiny of vehicle emissions. The misfire detection algorithms currently required by OBD2 only watches for misfires during driving conditions that occur during the prescribed driving cycles. It does not monitor misfires during other engine operating modes like full load for example. More sophisticated methods of misfire detection (as previously discussed in Chapter 7) will become common place. These systems can feed back other information to the ECU about the combustion process; for example, the maximum cylinder pressure, detonation events or work done (via an Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) calculation). This adds another dimension to the engine control system allowing greater efficiency and more power from any given engine design by just using more sophisticated ECU control strategy.",
                        "Future OBD system will undoubtedly incorporate new developments in sensor technology. Currently the evaluation is done via sensors monitoring emissions indirectly. Clearly an improvement would be the ability to measure exhaust gas composition directly via on-board measurement (OBM) systems. This is more in keeping with emission regulation philosophy and would overcome the inherent weakness of current OBD systems; that is, they fail to detect a number of minor faults that do not individually activate the MIL, or cause excessive emissions but whose combined effect is to cause the production of excess emissions.",

Some progress has been made with respect to this and some vehicles are now being fitted with NOx sensors. Currently there does appear to be gap between the laboratory based sensors used in research and reliable mass produced units that could form the basis of an on-board monitoring (OBM) system.

As air flows over the hot wire it cools it down and this produces the output signal. The sensor measures air mass because the air temperature is taken into account due to its cooling effect on the wire.The voltage output should be linear to airflow. This can be measured on an oscilloscope and should look similar to Figure4.6. The waveform should show approximately 1.0 volt when the engine is at idle. This voltage will rise as the engine is accelerated and air volume is increased producing an initial peak. This peak is due to the initial influx of air and drops momentarily before the voltage is seen to rise again to another peak of approximately 4.0 to 4.5 V. This voltage will however depend on how hard the engine is accelerated; a lower voltage is not necessarily a fault within the meter.On deceleration the voltage will drop sharply as the throttle butterfly closes, reducing the airflow, and the engine returns back to idle. The final voltage will drop gradually on an engine fitted with idle speed control valve as this will slowly return the engine back to base idle as an anti-stall characteristic. This function normally only affects the engine speed from around 1200 rev/min back to the idle setting.A time base of approximately 2 seconds plus is used because this allows the output voltage on",

Vehicles fitted with drive by wire systems allow the cruise control to operate the same actuator. A motor can be used to control the throttle cable or in many cases a vacuum operated diaphragm is used which is controlled by three simple valves. This technique is shown in Figure9.59. When the speed needs to be increased valve 'x' is opened allowing low pressure from the inlet manifold to one side of the diaphragm. The atmospheric pressure on the other side will move the diaphragm and hence the throttle. To move the other way valve 'x' is closed and valve 'y' is opened allowing atmospheric pressure to enter the chamber. The spring moves the diaphragm back. If both valves are closed then the throttle position is held. Valve 'x' is normally closed and valve 'y' normally open; thus in the event of electrical failure cruise will not remain engaged and the manifold vacuum will not be disturbed. Valve 'z' provides extra safety and is controlled by the brake and clutch pedalsMain switchThis is a simple on/off switch located in and warning easy reach of the driver on the lamp dashboard. The warning lamp can be part of this switch or part of the main instrument display as long as it is in the driver's field of vision 'Set' and These are fitted either on the steering 'Resume'",

Don't let two and two make five, but do let it act as a pointer. Remember that in the science of logical diagnostics, two and two always makes four! However, until you know this for certain then play the best odds to narrow down the fault. The further tests carried out would now be directed by your thinking at stage three. You don't yet know if the fault is a leaking head gasket, the thermostat stuck closed or some other problem. Playing the odds, a cooling system pressure test would probably be the next test. If the pressure increases when the engine is running then it is likely to be a head gasket or similar problem. If no pressure increase then move on to the next test and so on. After each test go back to stage 3 and evaluate what you know, not what you don't know! • Stage 5 Let's assume the problem was a thermostat stuck closed -replace it and top up the coolant, etc.",
