This module provides a service for processing PDF documents through the GROBID
service. GROBID (GeneRation Of BIbliographic Data) extracts, parses, and
restructures raw documents (such as PDFs) into structured TEI (Text Encoding
Initiative) encoded documents with a particular focus on technical and
scientific publications.

    Processes a PDF file through the GROBID service and saves the output in TEI

    This method sends the specified PDF to the GROBID server for processing and
    saves the resulting TEI XML to a specified file path. It includes
    handling for request timeouts.

        message if a timeout occurs.

    Note:
        The 'file' variable within the 'with' block for reading the PDF is
